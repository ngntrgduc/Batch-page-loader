Open multiple links in a flash âš¡.

## What is this?
A picture is worth a thousand words:

| Start page | Options page |
|:---:|:---:|
|![](/images/page.png) | ![](/images/options.png) |

This extension can open a link when you click on it and multiple links when you click on the group name. Time-saver.

## How to use
Open the extension's Options page, and paste your link with the following format:

```
<name> | <link>
```

When you want to open the link, click on the name of it.
If you want to group multiple links, put the group name in the following format:

```
# <group name>
```

and after that, put links under the group name
