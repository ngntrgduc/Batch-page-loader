# Multiple links loader
Open multiple links in a flash âš¡.

## What is this?
A picture is worth a thousand words:

|:---:|:---:|
|![](/images/page.png) | ![](/images/options.png) |

This extension can open a link when you click on it and multiple links when you click on the group name. Time-saver.

## How to use
Open the extension's Options page, and paste your link with the following format:

```
<name> | <link>
```

When you want to open the link, click on the name of it.
If you want to group multiple links, put the group name in the following format:

```
# <group name>
```

and after that, put links under the group name

Here are the basic options:

```
# Social
Discord | https://discord.com/channels/@me
LinkedIn | https://www.linkedin.com/notifications/
Twitter | https://twitter.com/home

# News

You can also add delay (default: 1 second, ranged from 0 to 2) when opening tabs if the number of tabs in the group exceeds the limit (default: 4 tabs, ranged from 0 to 99).
