# Multiple links loader
Open multiple links in a flash âš¡.

This extension can open a link when you click on it and multiple links when you click on the group name. Time-saver.

## Installation
Extension available on [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multiple-links-loader/).

### Local

1. Clone this repository/[download zip](https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Multiple-links-loader/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract to a folder on your local machine.

```git
git clone https://github.com/ngntrgduc/Multiple-links-loader.git
```

2. Load extension:
   - **Chrome:**  `Settings` -> `Extensions`.
   - **Edge:**    `Extensions` -> `Manage Extensions`.

   Then turn on `Developer mode`. Finally, click `Load unpacked` and select the folder you have just cloned/downloaded.

   - **Firefox:** Go to `about:debugging`, click `Load Temporary Add-on...`, then select `manifest.json` in the `firefox` folder.

## How to use
Open the extension's Options page using `Alt` + `Shift` + `L`, and paste your link with the following format:

```
<name> | <link>
```

Here are the basic options:

```

Use `Alt` + `L` to open the extension main page. You can also toggle ignore tabs by `Alt` + `Left click`. When opening a group, ignored tabs won't open.

**Firefox only**: You can also add delay (default: 1 second, ranged from 0 to 2) when opening tabs if the number of tabs in the group exceeds the limit (default: 4 tabs, ranged from 0 to 99).
